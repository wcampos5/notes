#### Primitive Data Type
They are predefined data types of Java.

When a primitive data type is **stored**, it is the **stack** that the values will be assigned.

When a **variable is copied** then another copy of the variable is created and ***changes*** made to the copied variable will ***not reflect*** changes in the ***original variable***.



#### Object Data Type
Referred to as Non-primitive or Reference Data Type.

Examples include arrays, strings, classes, interfaces etc.

When the ==**reference**== variables will be stored, the variable will be ===**stored in the stack**=== and the ===original object will be stored in the **HEAP**===.


Now letâ€™s look at a program that demonstrates the difference between the primitive and object data types in Java.
