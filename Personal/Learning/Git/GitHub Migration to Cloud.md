#### Q&A
***

_Does migration tools can migrate users?_
**No, because since userid changes (userid_ford) the personal token changes**

_How to handle old commits that is pointing to Nexus?_

_Does the tokens needs to be regenerated?_

_Does the pipelines will still running smoothly?_
**It needs to be re-aligned once the url will change.
Also, the webhook will change**
