### 5 Key Principles:
***

#### 1. Ensure quality built in at every step.
This can be achieved by continually reviewing error codes.
Every pull request is an opportunity for a code review and quality check.

#### 2. Work in small batches.
Make your user story small. (==less changes less risks==)

>[!quote] Never drift too far form the base that everyone else is working from


#### 3. People solving problems.
People shouldn't need to perform repetitive tasks, they get easily bored and distracted.

Please test driving development, you could manually pull and test code.

#### 4. Pursue continuous improvement.
Continuous delivery enables continuous improvement.
 Know where you are and when things get are broken.
 
#### 5. Every one is responsible.
If a build breaks:
- Don't ask:
>[!quote] whose fault is it?

- Do Ask:
  >[!quote] Why did this fail?
  >>What can we do to stop this from occurring again?
