Its a systemic approach to execute engineering disciplines to avoid it failures.
Uses tools to identify and eliminates failures earlier in the engineering processes as possible.

#### Default questions to avoid failures:
 - What is the component system?
 - What does the system or component do?
 - What happens if the system or component goes wrong?
 - What can go wrong?
 - Why could the system or component go wrong?
 - How can the system or component be prevented from going wrong?
 - How can check that the system or component won't go wrong?

To help organize the Q&A there are FMA Tools that give structure to these questions and document the outcome to guide the engineering process.
