Answer questions like:
 - What we do with the vehicle
 - What happens in the lab
 - How they correlate
 - How shielding impacts these results.

#### Main 4 Corrosion Mechanism

###### Open \/ General
*The metal surface serves as both the anode and the cathode, so the water and the oxygen take part in the reaction, but the cathode is the surface.*
Local anodic and cathodic on surface
More uniform
###### Crevice
*This is where you have low oxygen, and it locally reduces the pH.
You have, you know, metal hydrolysis and you're getting a more acidic environment*
Oxygen deficient region

Solutions:
	Coating
	Adhesive / Sealer
	Grease
	Wax
###### Filiform
Cathode chasing anode.
Reaction take place at the anode and the corrosion product (reduction reaction) is at the tail

###### Galvanic
*There's an anode and a cathode, and it's the anode that's always sacrificed.
So in galvanic, the reaction can be quite rapid and quite severe. So this is the third corrosion mechanism and it tends to be very aggressive.*



#### Ford vehicle accelerated Corrosion Cycle R-343
The vehicles actually drive into these large chambers after they've been on the test track.
They'll spend 88% of the time in the chamber  (6000 miles).
Four hours of driving and it will see structural events.
You go through the vehicle, shake down, the salt spray, dust track, stone pecking, structural tracks. You'll see highway miles. Then it'll go through the salt dust track again, then into the corrosion chamber.


#### Ford Laboratory Corrosion Cycle L467
Accelerate 6 years in 12 weeks
