#### Julie Lavine

3 Tremendous Challenger areas
- ***Increasing Product Complexity***
	*Our features a so advanced and have to cross multiple functions and connectivity. It increase complexity for the technical integrations:
	Software, Electrical, Electrical Mechanic and mechanical and connectivity*
- ***Increasing the density of interaction***
	- Internal
		Cross functional and connectivity.
	- External
		Vehicle and the cloud infrastructure, network and even pedestrian feedback.
		
- ***Frequency of changes***
	- Continuous changes requires meet customer demand keeping features fresh and exciting.
	- Frequently updates also requires the change of technologie 


#### System Architecture
- Get into the details too soon.
- I do need to leverage right models, with right fidelity at the right time to no waist resources

#### VEV Engineer
- Create a robust engineering test plan to ensure we are delivering a great flawless to our customers.
- Ensure to improve our **Design Verification Efficiency**
- Minimize costs and prototype costs
- Complete all test on time

#### Feature Owner
- High level customers one, marketing ideas.
- A holistic complete design.
- Learning by our stockholders as aligning for a  feature and function definition


#### Value Proposition
- Systems engineering value proposition
	- It an industrial standard chart developed across 150 large complex PD projects.


The way we read is the X axis is the project time line and the Y axis is the impact on the design.
It shows the puttinh the Systems Engineering early in the project improves the out come within the biggest impact on the design.

This action:
Reduces the cost, improve warranties and reduce the time to delivery the final product.

When the company allocated their resources to the earlier concepts definitions the  amount of time for detail design, integration and test is reduced.

#### System Engineer Definition
Incose[^1]

1. 
2. System Engineering is a Set of Process, Tools, and Languages

##### What is?
- Engineering discipline
	Consistently divided in systems
	Meeting stockholder needs and function correctly
	Cost effective manner
	
>[!quote]
>Systems engineering is a transdisciplinary and integrative approach to enable the successful realization, use, and retirement of engineering systems principles and concepts, and scientific, technological, and management methods.
>An engineered system is a combination of interacting elements organized to achieve one or more stated purporses    

System engineer considers the complete problems:
Schedulers, Lifecycle Costs, Operational Environment, Manufacture and the logistics.

#### System Thinking

##### Principles:
Holistic
Boundary
Interaction
Layer Hierarchy
Relations
Change

Considering a vehicle:
![[system_thinking_principles_vehicle.png]]

###### Holistic
From design thinking perspective we need to put everything together in a holistic vision.

![[system_thinking_principles_vehicle_holistic.png]]

##### Boundary
Refers to the external actors like other vehicles, people, infrastructure...

###### Interaction
Consider internal Features, it's subsystems and boundary environment

###### Layer Hierarchy
Refer to decompose the system into smaller systems, also called ***System partitioned*** 

Example: **CPSC Code**
Decompose the vehicle into 7 main systems or organizations

###### Relations
Describe interconnection between elements.
Typical relation is the *feedback loop*:
	Examples:
		Accelerate the vehicle
		AC internal and external temperature

###### Change
Must adapt to external environment:
	Hot, Could or Dust


#### 2. System Engineering is a Set of Process, Tools, and Languages

[ISO15288](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GOVPUB-C13-c25c4bc1a2f4ce59b0e727473363724e/pdf/GOVPUB-C13-c25c4bc1a2f4ce59b0e727473363724e.pdf)

Core Processes

![[system_engineering_process.png]]

##### Technical processes
	Focus in technical design, testing, operating and the retirement activities.
##### Technical Management Process
	Manage techinal risks:
		Met the custumers requirements
		Management product or program configuration variation
		Access and and manage process performance
		Trace information flows
		Manage interfaces
		
##### Agreement Process
\&
##### Organizational project-enabling processes
	Manage logistics
	Lifecycle cost analyses 
	Human resource
	Knowledge

Those process are distributed through:
***Concept, development, production, utilization, support, and retirement***

##### System V Framework
#systemv #vmodel

In the V model system maturity proceed from left to right
![[systemv.png]]

V-Model
Starts analyzing the business needs, Identifying the concept finding requirements, functionality, document requirements, design architecture and then proceed to *Design System*
Decomposing system and sub-system into *Elements*, analizing and improving design by modeling optimization, then buildinding part which is the...
*Implementation*

#### SE languages and Tools
Engineers embraces **Modeling** and **Simulations**

##### Modeling supports
- Requirements
- Design
- Analisys
- Verification and Validation activities
Begin in *Concept Design phase*->Development->Lifecycle phase

Modeling base is the opportunity to arguments, formalize and add more rigor to SE.

Helps the consistency, Technical Rigor, Knowledge Retention, Center source of thruth and a Common Mental Model

###### Multi-Languages:
Type: SysML can describe system requirements, behavior, structures, and paramenters

###### Simulation Models
Can test the concepts quicker at the earlier each ratio of different concepts



#### Functional Safety
Functional Safety is the absence of a reasonable risk due amount functional behavior, electrical and electronic features.

MBSE - Model Base System Engineering
#mbse
Improves Communication, Abstraction, and Automation



#### FMA Application
Failure Model Analysis
#fma 

FMA is the first thing to start and the last to be re-validated.
