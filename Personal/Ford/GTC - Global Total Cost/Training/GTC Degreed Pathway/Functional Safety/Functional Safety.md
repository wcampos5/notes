ISO 26262 - Standard for Functional Safety
***

#### Operational Safety
	Nominal function and performance
	Addresses the contrains, systems to be safety
>[!Example]
>Windows system maximum allowed force to close the window

#### Operating Safety
	User-system interaction 
	between the user and the system
>[!example]
>Prevents unintended use of a power window button by user

#### Material Safety
Rules and mechanisms to avoid contact or exposure to undesired materials that cause some injury

## ==Functional Safety==

>[!success] Definition
>The absence of unreasonable risk due to hazards caused by malfunctioning behavior of electric/electronic systems

Safe behavior of electric or electronic systems, known as **EE Systems**

>[!example]
>Functional Safety ensures that the power windows system is design such as reduce the risk of faults that lead to unintended activation.

#### Safety of other technologies
Non Electric or Electronic elements


#### ISO 26262 Definitions

|Term|Definition|Example|
|----|----------|-------|
|Risk|Combination of the probability of the occurrence of the harm and its severity|Probability of side collision on the highway and the severity of injuries |
|Harm|Phisical injury or damage to the health of persons|Spinal injury, arm and rib fractures|
|Hazard|Potential source of harm caused by malfunctioning behavior of the feature|Unwanted steering wheel torque|

#### Rigorous Functional Safety Process

#### Functional Safety Scope

>[!success] Scope
>E/E Safety-related systems



>[!failure] Out of scope
>Interaction of Human or Vehicle as a control system.
>Additionally: Fire, Toxicity and Electric Shock (not directly caused by EE) 


###### Safety Failure Modes
- Specification Error
- Design Failure
- Production error
- Failure during operation
- Failure during decommissioning


#### Aftermarket Scenarios

###### 1. Ford aftermarket product
	Follow functional safety process for the life cycle
###### 2. Ford-created interface
	To install some device in the vehicle
###### 3. Third-Party part or modification
	Supplier is reponsible for implementing the functional safety process.


#### Role of Functional Safety

###### Functional Safety x FMA

| |Functiona Safety|FMA|
|--|--|-|
|Primary Focus|Preventing potential E/E malfunctions|Preventing potentional failure modes|
|Key Output|List of potential and Safety Goals with associated Automotive Safety Integrity Level \(ASIL\) ratings|DFMEA: List of potential failure modes, causes, special characteristics, risk levels, recommended actions to mitigate the risk, and measures to control or prevent failures|


#### Functional Safety Process

#### Complexity and Functional Safety

>[!quote] 
>Functional Safety addresses problems inherent to complex system design by providing methods to avoid failures during the development nd operating of E/E system
