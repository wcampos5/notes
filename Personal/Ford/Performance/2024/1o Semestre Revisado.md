The beginning of this year presented both exciting opportunities and challenges as I joined end of last year the Global Total Cost team. I **owned** my role, **delivering** on the following key assignments:
- **Led** the weekly FSA Total Cost team meetings, **seeking to understand** the needs of each participant, prioritize the subjects and time and driving productive discussions.
- **Led** the tasks and meetings supporting the Fuel System team, **solving together** with the Global Total Cost and QlikSense teams to **deliver** a robust System Quality Dashboard in QlikSense.
- - As a programmer I have worked together a team member to deliver a Python web-scraping software for the GTC team, **doing only what matters** by programmatically interacting with the CRID (Cost Reduction Idea Database) system. This automated rejections based on provided lists, **eliminating** manual errors and saving valuable time.
- - **Delivered** direct support for the onboarding of a new team member (LREIS24), **seeking to understand** their needs and ensuring a smooth transition.

In late February, I transitioned to the Prognostics team, a period of significant change as services previously managed in India were transferred to Brazil. I **embraced** this transition, **demonstrating a bias for action** by:

- **Actively participating** in Knowledge Transfer meetings, **seeking to understand** the intricacies of pipeline deployments.
- **Collaborating** with the Prognostics team on the following key initiatives:
    - **Delivered** support for Jenkins during the transition to Tekton.
    - **Owned** the development and deployment of Tekton pipelines for critical services, including Oil Life, Schedule Maintenance, Tire Slow Leak, Metrics, and Telemetry.
    - **Delivered** a streamlined maintenance process by consolidating all service pipelines into a single, optimized system and reducing the code maintenance.
    - **Led** the development and implementation of the new Tekton pipeline as Code for Batch Pipelines, supporting the new ML architecture.
	- **Delivered** ongoing maintenance, deployment, and error resolution for Tekton pipelines within the 12VBHM and TSL new architecture.
	- **Led** the design of a robust branching strategy and the prognostics deployment process.
	- **Owned** the maintenance of Github prognostics repositories.
	- 
**Beyond my core responsibilities, I also:**

- **Delivered** all mandatory Integrity trainings on time, demonstrating my commitment to ethical conduct and company values.
- **Engaged** in the Mentoring Software Team program, **mentoring** new employee Lucas Guimarães (LGUIMA15), sharing my knowledge and experience to support his growth.
- **Delivered** and revised the People Flow assessment with my people leader, demonstrating my commitment to continuous improvement and process enhancement.


#### What Work was Done

Global Total Cost (Jan to Feb, 2024)
Led the weekly FSA Total Cost team meetings
- Lead the tasks and meetings supporting Fuel System team to work with Global Total Cost and QlikSense team to developer the System Quality Dashboard in the QlikSense. 
- Work with the team in a development of a Python web scrapping software to GTC team that deals programmatically with the CRID (Cost Reduction Idea Database) web-based system to automatically perform rejections based on a provided list as input. This helps the team avoid any manual deletion errors and wasting time consumption.
- Directly support the onboard of a new team member (LREIS24)
