The beginning of this year has been both intriguing and challenging, as I started the year working with the Global Total Cost team. Among other tasks, I assisted the team with the following assignments:
- Led the weekly FSA Total Cost team meetings
- Lead the tasks and meetings supporting Fuel System team to work with Global Total Cost and QlikSense team to developer the System Quality Dashboard in the QlikSense. 
- Work with the team in a development of a Python web scrapping software to GTC team that deals programmatically with the CRID (Cost Reduction Idea Database) web-based system to automatically perform rejections based on a provided list as input. This helps the team avoid any manual deletion errors and wasting time consumption.
- Directly support the onboard of a new team member (LREIS24)

At the end of February, I was transferred to the Prognostics team. The Prognostics team was undergoing a transition where services previously assigned to the team in India were being transferred to Brazil.
In parallel with my onboarding, I attended Knowledge Transfer meetings (especially those related to pipeline deployments).
In the Prognostics team, I collaborated with the team on the following actions:
- Jenkins support in the meanwhile transition to Tekton
- Act and support the Tekton pipeline development and deployments for the Services:
	- Oil Life, Schedule Maintenance, Tire Slow Leak, Metrics, Telemetry
- I have communized all the services pipelines into only one, optimizing the maintenance.
- Act and support the new Tekton pipeline as Code for Batch Pipelines for the new ML architecture
- Support the team with the Tekton pipelines maintenance, deployments and fixing errors for 12VBHM and TSL new architecture.
- Leading branching strategy design and prognostics deployment process
- Github prognostics repositories maintenance
Additionally:
- I have completed all the mandatory Integrity trainings on time
- Engaged on the Mentoring Software Team program, mentoring the new employee Lucas Guimar√£es (LGUIMA15) 
- Delivery and revised the People Flow assessment with my people leader
